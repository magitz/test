# Git Activity

This is a template repo for the 2nd git activity in module 1 of the Git and GitHub Workshop

This activity will be used along with the quiz in Canvas. The quiz will ask you questions about the repository which you can only answer by using the repo.

This activity will also mirror, in some ways, the slides from Dr. Silva's video recording. In that recording, she walked through the idea of snapshots using an example pictured below.

Remember, this repo started with a README.md file--maybe this very file you are reading now!

Then a folder called "Animal_functionality" and a Python script, "Animal.py" was added. Since we don't really want to work with Python code in this exercise, we are changing things up a bit and the new file will be a Markdown file, called "Animal.md".

Also note that the commit history, and the resulting snapshots, will be different than the simplified example used in the video.

## Instructions

You should already have the Canvas quiz that accompanies this exercise opened, if not, open it now.

The first step was using GitHub Classroom to accept this assignment.

Now you can clone this onto your computer to work through the quiz and answer the questions.
